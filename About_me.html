			I have been going to newroads school since sixth grade. I went to a school up in Seattle before I came to newroads. My favorite subjects in school are science and world civ. Both of the classes are really intresting and the people in the class are really nice and funny.

			I am in 9th grade. I really love high school much better than middle school for manu reasons.
			<ul>
				<li> The over all vibe is much more relaxing and chill.</li>
				<li> The teachers I have are really nice and very suportive. </li>
				<li> This is more of a pro and con, we dont have hallways, are path between are classrooms are out side. </li>

			Some of my favorite games to play is League of Lengens and Assisan Creed. I have not play league of lengens in a long time but it is still one of my favorite games to play. You need a lot of time to play it though. and assian creed, I play it alot. it is on the xbox and it is a really fun game. I like to play games that have a misson to do but you can also just play around and explore the game map.
